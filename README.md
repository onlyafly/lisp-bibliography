# A Lisp Bibliography

*by Kevin Albrecht*

A bibliography of reading material on Lisps (Common Lisp, Scheme, Clojure, etc.) and related research. Sometimes only quite vaguely related...

I prefer resources that are broadly applicable over ones that are highly specific, which means that I am heavy on things that teach you ideas and concepts over technologies. Technologies are transitory, while concepts will be with you forever.
